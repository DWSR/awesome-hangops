## Remote Setup

### Desks

- [Fully Jarvis](https://www.fully.com/standing-desks/jarvis.html) - Many hangops members swear by their Fully Jarvis sit/stand desks.
- [VIVO](https://vivo-us.com/) - VIVO is a lower cost option than others but has a great product and an excellent support team. 

### Chairs

- [Herman Miller Aeron](https://www.hermanmiller.com/en_gb/products/seating/office-chairs/aeron-chairs/) - Nobody got fired for buying an Aeron
- [Steelcase Leap](https://www.steelcase.com/products/office-chairs/leap/) - strong competitor in the same price range as the Aeron.

**Note:** chairs can often be bought refurbished or second hand from office surplus/used furniture stores, sometimes for 50% or more off the price, so search around if you're on a budget.
